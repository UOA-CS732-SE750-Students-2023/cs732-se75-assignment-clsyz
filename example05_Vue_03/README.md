2. Computed property:
    1. concept: After a series of operations, an attribute value is finally obtained.
    2. features:
        1. It is defined as a method when it is declared, but it is essentially an attribute.
        2. Only when the data that the calculation attribute depends on changes, the calculation will be recalculated.
